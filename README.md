# Welcome!

Hello! I'm a software engineer. Here, you'll find a mix of professional projects that showcase my interests and skills.

## Professional Bio

I've been a professional developer for 11+ years and have worked on so many kinds of projects in that time:

- a Natural Language Parsing (NLP) compiler
- multiple plugins for Unreal Engine
- a 20+ year old legacy monoliths
- a greenfield enterprise-scale B2B integration

Most recently, the majority of my time has been in designing and building **AWS Serverless APIs and Event-Driven Automation**.

## Professional Skills (aka Favorite Tech)

- **Cloud Computing** – AWS, GCP, Firebase
- **Infrastructure as Code** – Terraform
- **Programming**– Python, Java/JVM, TypeScript
- **CI/CD** – GitHub Actions

## My Philosophy

- **Encourage Open Systems** – Favor transparency, collaboration, and user freedom over closed, proprietary solutions.
- **Enable Others** – Instead of just solving a problem for yourself, create tools and frameworks that help others solve problems.
- **Challenge Buearocracy** – Question centralized control, gatekeeping, and artificial constraints in technology and society where possible.
- **Engineer for Empowerment** – Design with the goal of making technology more accessible, understandable, and useful to people, especially those historically excluded.
- **Tinker First, Ask Later** – Experimentation and hands-on learning are the best ways to discover solutions.

## Additional Interests

When I’m not working, I enjoy other technical projects like reconfiguring my synthesizers, updating my home server, and other creative hackery.

## Get in Touch

I'm always looking to collaborate on exciting projects. Hit me up!
